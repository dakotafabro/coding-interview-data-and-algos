# merge-- (helper function)
# real-world application/visualization - classroom: combining two separate classes of students already in line order,
# but there are gaps, so they need to be combined AND sorted a second time--creating a new sorted line

# merge-sort--
# real-world application/visualization - classroom: break lines in half until each student is standing separately
# then uses merge to put the lists back together
