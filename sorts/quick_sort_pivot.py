# quick sort--
# real-world application/visualization - classroom: lining students up by height by:
# taking the first student's height
# comparing their height to everyone else's
# note all the heights that are less than the first student's height, place then on the left of the student
# all on the right are now taller than the first student (who is now in the middle of the line).
# Continue the process on the shorter students.
# Continue the process on the taller students.
# Once all student heights are addressed, the line is sorted


# pivot--
# real-world application/visualization - classroom: helps pivot the students by the "middle height" students of each group
